# # Hello

I've been procrastinating creating this blog but it's crucial so that I have a place that I can con consolidate my notes. I probably will be the only person to read this but I hope it to be of value to myself and whoever else sees it. 

I wanted this blog to have a retro feel. Recently my father-in-law showed me an old IBM P70 8573-121 "Luggable" computer (with keyboard and serial mouse) he used as his work computer, which had DOS and Windows 3.1 installed.

It was amazing to see the UI (black screen with orange text). I was surprized to see that the very little DOS commands I knew (cd, dir, mkdir, ver) worked on the terminal. Also, seeing the Windows 3.1 logo at the boot screen was cool. This version of Windows is probably more secure or at least not compromised then anything pass Windows 95... 

All in all, I liked the UI. The text was easy to see in DOS which made me wonder why Microsoft went to Black and WHite for CMD or Blue and white-ish for Powershell. I picked an orange and black theme for now for the new beginnigs of this blog. 

# # Projects

I wanted to document all the projects I have going on at the moment or what I want to work on in the future. 

I'm currently in the middle of a lot projects at the moment:
- Writing more Rust code in general 
- Creating a cheatsheet of common programming tasks I have performed in the past 
- I have a lot of electronical projects I should place on here 
- I started looking into the Certified Kubernetes Administrator 

Future projects:
- Start self hosting 
  

## Starting Off 

I've been studying Rust on and off for the past year. I mostly write in Go and Python (although I've been rewriting my Python scripts in Golang) but I feel Rust has a future. I think it will be my trifecta (Rust, Go, Bash) as what a serious Software Engineer should know. 

I think right now I wanted to focus on my "Rust for the rest of us" series on here. Here's a taste of what to come, the obligatory starting off hello world program. 

## ## A quick demo

```rs
fn main() {
    println!("hello, there");
}
```

## The End 

> That is it for now. I still need to set up the structure for this space.
